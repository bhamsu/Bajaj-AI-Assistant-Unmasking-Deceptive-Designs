# Bajaj Doc AI - Python
Developed a system for medical document analysis, summarization, template generation, and fraud detection system. Every day a large number of invoices, prescriptions, and lab reports are sent from different businesses like doctors, hospitals, and customers to any insurance company. Manually handling all those documents, identifying frauds, and settling insurance claims without digital assistance was very complex and time-consuming. Our project delivers a system that works as an AI assistant to increase the company's efficiency and expand cutting-edge technologies to its workflow.
